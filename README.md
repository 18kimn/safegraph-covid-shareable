# Demographics repository for _U.S. regional differences in physical distancing_

### Evaluating racial and socioeconomic divides during the COVID-19 pandemic

This repository hosts Census data cleaned and used in the above paper.

`scrape_demographics.R` here should be the main code of interest. This uses the `tidycensus` 
package to scrape (lots of) data from the Census Bureau's API, then saves it to the `scraped/` folder.

The rest of our paper depends on proprietary SafeGraph data, but we're 
happy to share the code and data for those if any researchers are interested. 

The GitHub repository for this project doesn't actually have the data,
since it's too large to upload, but you can access it via a Google Drive 
link of this repository here:
